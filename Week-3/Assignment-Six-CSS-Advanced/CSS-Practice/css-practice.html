          Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database
          has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a
          milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed
          something wrong, What it was I could not say.
        </p>

        <p>Now all my data's gone And I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.</p>
        <p>
          Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data
          was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.
