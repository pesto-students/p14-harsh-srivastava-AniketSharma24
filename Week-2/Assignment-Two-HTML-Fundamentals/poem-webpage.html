    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you?</p>
    <p>Are you - Nobody - Too?</p>
    <p>Then there's a pair of us!</p>
    <p>Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>
    <p>How dreary - to be - Somebody!</p>
    <p>How public - like a Frog -</p>
    <p>To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!</p>
